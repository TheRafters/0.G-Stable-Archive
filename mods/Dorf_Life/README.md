# Dorf Life, a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead and Cataclysm: Bright Nights

This mod focuses on adding caverns that randomly breach the depths of subway tunnels (if only sewers were an option, but they won't mesh up cleanly), expanding the underground with areas full of various flora, fauna, and strange encounters.

If you are using Dark Days Ahead, place the included Dorf_Life folder in your data/mods folder. If you are using the Bright Nights fork, use the Dorf_Life_BN folder instead. In either case it is recommended that, if updating the mod, to delete the older version of the folder rather than just dumping the new one onto the old one.

## Features

* Caverns of various sizes and randomized depths, with various debris, pillars, and other things to make the appearance more organic.
* Pools (including magma, of course), pockets of radiation, evidence of failed expeditions, buried ruins (mundane or otherwise), and stranger things can show up.
* Exotic underground "plants" that can be harvested at various periods of the year, with varied uses as well.
* A wide variety of cavern critters that can show up, at a fairly consistent spawn rate.
* Unique sprites for all terrain added (with a focus on still being visually distinct in the dark), and for almost all items added.

## Planned Features

* Finales for caverns that reach maximum length.
* Changing surface caves to use a similar system.
* A scenario to allow diving into exploration.
