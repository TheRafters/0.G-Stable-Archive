    "description": "Bring a little light to your darkness. Street and traffic lights are still working hard, dim as they are. And those flag enthusiasts sure build to last! Last minute addition of a makeshift light pole. It's a bit flimsy, but you won't burst a hernia hauling it around. Created for Cataclysm ver. 0.G Stable. (It is very simplistic, will likely work on experimental with minor tweaks.) TODO: Convert overwrites to copy-from/extend.",
