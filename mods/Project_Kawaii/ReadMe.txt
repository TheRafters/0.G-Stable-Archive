A translation and modified version of "KawaiiMaidMod v2.7.4" to work with the latest experimental version of CDDA.

● Changes from original 
	No prerequisite mods. Technically compatible with most tilesets, but works best with UDP or ChibiUltica.
	All of the AMTS related content now uses the vanilla crafting system and has it's own crafting category.
	To start you need [AMTS] Transmitter, [AMTS] Receiver, 10 [AMTS] Points, and [AMTS] A&M Employee's Manual Tier 1.
	Transmitter and Receiver recipes can be found in "Amateur Home Radio for Enthusiasts", or you can find everything mansions or spawned with using one of the Cute professions.
	Craft a [AMTS] Packaging System using the items and use it to craft one of the compressed matters then craft into points and repeat for more points.
	To unlock more AMTS recipes you need to craft the higher tier A&M manuals.
	There is no AMTS rank implemented yet, no limit to shipping, no daily points, teleportation, or debug wands.
	All items have recipes and stats adjusted to match preexisting items in vanilla CDDA.
