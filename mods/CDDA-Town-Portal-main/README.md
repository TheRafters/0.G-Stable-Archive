# Town Portal
A very simple plug-and-play mod that adds a Diablo-style Town Portal spell. Takes one full minute to cast, so don't try casting it in combat.
Can be added to existing saves.

## How to Use the Portal
- Craft a "town portal scroll". It costs nothing and can be made anywhere!
- Activate the scroll to learn the spell "Set Home".
- Cast "Set Home" to set the spot you're currently standing on as your home point.
- After casting "Set Home" for the first time you will learn the spell "Town Portal".
- Casting "Town Portal" warps you to your home point. Casting it again warps you back to where you just were.
That's it!

Be warned that setting a new home point will remove any away point you might have -- the next casting of Town Portal will take you to that new home point.

### But couldn't you abuse the system if you...
Yes! It would be super easy to abuse this spell in ways unintended, or basically cheat with it. But it would take 10x the total coding time to put in enough safeguards to stop this, and there would still probably be ways around it. Instead I'll just assume you're an adult who can play the mod the way you want and if you want to cheat you're just going to cheat anyway. Do what you like!
