# Lore
Figure it out for yourself. For the most part, the average joe would have no clue what really caused the cataclysm and I prefer to keep it that way for the player.
On the whole, the world of magic got out of hand as it became more and more popular. Ghost sightings and religious phenomena, mostly. More magic, more problems.


#Mod Info
Corporate Magic is essentially a magic expansion aimed at creating a more video-gamey way to play C:DDA. It's highly focused on tiers of expansion, resource 
management and creating new and more dangerous potential scenarios for the player to find themselves in. So far, it adds: 
-19 new monsters, 5 ghosts, 5 demons, 5 magic circles and 5 mages. 
-A new npc/shopkeeper, the Magic Operator, and the many places you might find them.
-Something close to 30 or so new unique items, I've lost count. Wigs, spellbooks, spell scrolls, magic doo-dads, weapons and armor, Invocations (one time use powers)
and Verges (expensive but very powerful wands.)
-A new system of bartering cash for miscellaneous resources via "altars of power" to be constructed by the player.
-Pacts, deals made with a mysterious otherworldly entity for power. Good and bad consequences.
-A plethora (~75) of new spells to experiment with. 
-5 professions: The Curious Private Eye, the Soon-To-Be Rancher, the Assets Recquisitions Department, the Useless Drunk, and the Blameless Dude/Dudette.
-Recipes to make it all happen. 
-The ability to select any spell at character creation for an associated amount of points. 
-The ability for base game and Magiclysm NPC's to generate knowing any spell in Magiclysm or Corporate Magic.
-More to be discovered.


All thanks to KorGgenT for creating Magiclysm in the first place. Hope it's enjoyed.
