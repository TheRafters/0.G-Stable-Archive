        "it's a popular model in the films, and is also favored by the military over offset sights",
        "effectively replaced with giving the fleshed-out ACOG a separate mount for RMR"

        "replaced by JP Enterprises 30 mm sight mount, which features a top rail over the front ring that could fit a sight"

      "u_shotgun": [
        "this one appears to be pure fiction and is thus disposed with",
        "effectively replaced by the 'not-Masterkey' underbarrel shotgun: the latter is more compact, holds more rounds, and is (presumably) easier to shoot"
      ],
      "stabilizer": [
        "gyroscopic stabilizers became a thing in 2020, having been tested for the Iron Man suit by the US Army",
        "by the looks of it, they weren't very ergonomic for use in the field",

      "tail_hook_stock": [
        "while a neat piece of firearm accessory, it's currently not very useful for the purpose it's designed to fulfill",
        "its main goal is to help fire a 'pistol' (including AR pistols) or an SMG one-handed, with the hook bracing against the shooter's arm to maintain stability",
        "since handedness (i.e. differentiation between which hand is being used) is currently not implemented, there's no way to really use this functionality",
        "beyond that, it's not even a full stock – it's a stock plate (or a stock hook, one would suppose) – and thus requires the rest of the tube to install onto, something that isn't currently implemented",
        "something like this would be a better fit for Gunsmith, with its intricate gunmod system overhaul"
      ],
      "sights_mount_launcher": [
        "attaching a plastic mount with screws only makes sense for a small number of launchers",
        "e.g. M79 (has wooden stock grip to drill into), China Lake launcher (likewise)",
        "even then, their construction makes the installation likely to be flimsy",
        "beyond that, research yields no authentic attempts at installing anything remotely similar"
      ],
      "gun_crossbow": [
        "this item appears to be pure fiction",
        "besides, mounting a crossbow powerful-enough to be effective under the barrel (let alone on a side rail) of a rifle would likely make the gun (1) much too heavy, (2) much too unwieldy (due to balance issues), (3) not fit into any possible holster or case"
