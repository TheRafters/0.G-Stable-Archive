  Everything is for version 0.G. All mods are sourced from Kenan's Modpack unless noted otherwise. UDP tileset files are included where available, if they weren't already present.

NOTE: I haven't updated this in quite awhile, I kind of forgot. *shrugs* Several of the individual mods got more detailed CHANGES.TXT in them.

ADoO -
    My personal changes to coremod. Un-nerfs, QoL, cheaty stuff and anything neat salvaged from otherwise terrible and broken mods goes here.

Project Kawaii -
    Updated the climate control on the Maid Uniform to work with new code changes. No checks for balance done :P

Merchant -
    Removed tihar and helsing from smith shop, as they don't exist.

Miscellaneous Magiclysm Expansion - 
    Change to vehicle part data format required to load, I believe I had to drop the unit and just use the number or vice versa.

Modular Turrets with no blacklist -
    The gnome-pocalypse is hereby cancelled.

Mutant Animals -
  Removed reproduction field from the glue horse, it was just there to increase the glue spawns and caused an error on load due to inheritence from mon_horse. KISS in action.

Mutant NPCs -
  Removed TRIGGERHAPPY trait as it's deprecated and makes Cataclysm unhappy.

Valkyria Mod -
  gun item groups extend instead of overwrite. Overmap special occurences reduced.

World on Fire -
  Itemgroup additions changed to extend instead of overwrite.
