This is just an easily-readable list of each psionic path, their powers, what the powers do, and some of my design intentions behind them

# Biokinesis

## Physical Enhancement

Relatively simple buff power. Adds +1 Strength/Dexterity and then +1 per 5 levels in the power. 

## Overcome Pain

Reduces pain by 5-15 after a short channeling time. What I really wanted to do was reduce pain up to a cap--like, you can only reduce your pain by 1.5 * power level or something--but that's currently impossible since there's no way to limit recover_energy spells, so the channeling time was added as a compromise. Biokinetics have to worry about pain in the short term, but as soon as they get a breather they're good as new.

## Heightened Reflexes

Adds +1 Perception and then +1 per 5 levels in the power, as well as +5 Speed and then +1 per level.  

## Hardened Skin

This is a flat armor buff (to preserve the utility of worn armor): 4 Cut/6 Bash/3 Stab, which is enough to blunt most damage from basic zombies. The side effects make in continually useful, though--while it's active your pain is reduced by 2% per power level and you're immune to bleeding and parasitic infection.

## Sealed System

The idea here is that your skin becomes an impermiable barrier and you also hold your breath (plus psychic powers), so it makes you immune to anything entering into or leaving your body. You don't bleed, you're immune to smoke or toxic gas, electricity grounds itself across the outer surface of your skin without ever penetrating deeper, and you resist radation. Doesn't last very long, though, and has to be used before those dangers present themselves. 

## Combat Dance

This is just a straight buff across the board. Reduced move cost, faster attack speed and more melee damage, and less gun recoil, but it increases your fatiue, hunger, and thirst slightly when you use it. 

# Clairsentience

## Night Vision

Provides night vision and infrared vision. Relatively simple.

## The Perfect Path

Reduces movement costs, representing predicting enemies' paths and taking the exact route to get away (or toward) them. Also reduces footstep noise by 2/3rds. For Clairsentience I partially went into prescience as well, so some of the powers involve gazing into the immediate future. 

## Clairvoyance

Seeing an area you can't physically see. Lasts a random number of seconds and then slowly fades.

## Combat Sense

Increases dodge and block attempts and provides the UNCANNY_DODGE flag. This is entirely a defensive buff, in keeping with Clairsentience's lack of offensive capabilities. It represents the clairsentient seeing their enemies' attacks before they happen. 

## Satellite View

Reveals the overmap around the player. Simple. 

## Clarity

This is a defensive buff against a number of different sensory conditions. Using it removes, and makes you immune to, blinding, deafening, stunning, intoxication, hallucinations, sunlight glare, and so on. 

# Pyrokinesis
