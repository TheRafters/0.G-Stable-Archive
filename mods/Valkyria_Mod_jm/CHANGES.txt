gun item groups - 
  too numerous for me to bother cross checking so I just made them all extend just in case. jfc this thing adds a lot of items. And i happen to know the items are junk because the armor offers "negligible protection" which is fun.

Removed "iv_mutagen" use_action as it's deprecated and causes a debug message on load. Stop gap until I can look into how mutation works now, I get the 2 part system but haven't read up on how the vitamins are defined beyond knowing it wasn't in the medicine with the rest of the vitamins... Homework!

Overmap Specials occurences reduced to sane levels. It was adding a minimum of 18 specials to each overmap. I made most of them have 0 for a minimum and reduced the maximum occurences by 2/3 in most cases. You might need to travel a bit to find them all, but now this mod won't crowd out other mods.
