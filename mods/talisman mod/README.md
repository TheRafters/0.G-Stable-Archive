# cdda-talisman-mod


After playing CDDA i decided to try my hand at a bit of modding, so here it comes another mod :D!

 #The aim
The aim of this mod is to add utility base items of already existing items, that while perpetual/easy to craft and storage, doesnt affect the balance too much or break it.
(like a light talisman, that is basically an eternal candle)

 #The planning
While the mod is basically scrapping ideas from other mods, and maybe just right out just copy-pasting the items under different names and recipes, im planning on adding some original tools/furniture, that helps quality of life in the game.
so any ideas suggestions will be welcome.

At the moment it just add some utility items and a spell class with the theme of a dungeon maker
